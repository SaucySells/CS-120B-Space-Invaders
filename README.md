# Space-Invaders

This is a project I made for my embedded systems class at UCR. It's programmed in C onto an ATMega1284 chip.

It has a few hardware add-ons, including a Nokia 5110 LCD screen and a 2-Axis Joystick. 

Based on the old arcade game "Space Invaders".

Supports both easy and hard difficulties. Also has a score system.
